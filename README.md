# Comments

The first macro finds comments on your data and prints them out in first open column but on same row.

The second macro moves entire row to new sheet for more examination. 


# Split Data

This Macro splits table rows (based off column F) into seperate worksheets. 
It then creates new workbooks for each worksheet and saved them in a location you are prompted to choose. 

It starts looping only from row 2. It also only copies column A:J. Change according to your needs. 

Just copy and paste code into your VBA Module and change the Column Number to your desired column.

# Ordinal Suffix Function

This switches numbers from cardinal numbers into ordinal numbers. Used for addresses in many locations.
